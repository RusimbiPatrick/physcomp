This [Notebook](FrequencyAnalysis/index.html) introduces frequency analysis, including Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFTs) and the intuition for how they work, Fast Fourier Transforms and spectral frequency plots, and Short-time Fourier Transforms (STFTs) and spectrograms.

You can view the Notebook in [html here](FrequencyAnalysis/index.html) ([ipynb](https://github.com/makeabilitylab/signals/blob/master/Tutorials/Signals%20-%20Frequency%20Analysis.ipynb)) but we also **strongly** recommend working with our Notebooks locally by performing a git clone on `https://github.com/makeabilitylab/signals.git` and running Jupyter Notebook on your system (see [installation notes](jupyter-notebook.md)).
