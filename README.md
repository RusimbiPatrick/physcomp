## Prerequisites

- **Some coding experience.** For the introductory lessons, we assume comfort and familiarity with basic coding concepts such as functions, loops, variables, and conditionals. We'll be using `C/C++` to program our microcontrollers; however, you need no previous experience with this language. If you've programmed in Java, Python, Ruby, Processing, JavaScript, or other similar languages, you should be fine. Later lessons require more advanced programming concepts such as memory management, library development, *etc.*

- **No previous experience with hardware.** In contrast, we assume no previous experience with electronics or microcontrollers.

## Learn by doing

A key pedagogical philosophy underlying this website and our teaching approach in general is **learning by doing**. From years of experience, we've found that the best way to teach physical computing is via hands-on exercises.

## Example Hardware Kits

## About this website

This website began as a response to teaching physical computing remotely due to Covid-19. Originally, my goal was simply to translate my lectures slides to more readable versions (to consult outside of lectures).
