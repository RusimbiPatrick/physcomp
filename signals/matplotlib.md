For visualizing our data, we'll be using [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)â€”an incredibly powerful visualization library with a bit of an eccentric API (thanks to Matlab). Open this [Notebook](https://github.com/makeabilitylab/signals/blob/master/Tutorials/IntroToMatplotlib.ipynb), learn about creating basic charts, and try to build some of your own. You will also learn more about plotting charts as you complete your assignments and interactive lessons.

We recommend working with our Notebooks locally by performing a git clone on `https://github.com/makeabilitylab/signals.git` and running Jupyter Notebook (see [installation notes](jupyter-notebook.md)). However, for quick access, you can use:
