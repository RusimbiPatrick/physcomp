Welcome ðŸ‘‹ to the third module in your Physical Computing adventure: **Advanced I/O**. Do not be intimidated by the **advanced** prefix. The content here is not more complicated than the first two modules, though they do build on them:
1. [Introduction to Electronics](../electronics/index.md)
2. [Introduction to Microcontrollers Using Arduino](../arduino/index.md)

As usual, these lessons are interactiveâ€”that is, they assume that you're following along and building **with us**. They are designed to be completed **in order**. All Arduino code is open source and in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/makeabilitylab/arduino).
