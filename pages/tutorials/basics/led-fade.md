Learn how to gradually fade an LED on and off using `analogWrite()`.

Outline:
1. Using a for loop: Fade LED on (then immediately go back to zero)
2. Using a for loop: Fade LED on and then off
3. Without a for loop: fade led on and off

For both, show graph of what happens either via Tinkercad serial plotter or the oscilloscope (oscilloscope would show PWM...)
