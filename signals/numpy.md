We'll be using the [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) library and [NumPy arrays](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.html) as one of our primary data structures. Use this notebook to build up some initial familiarity. You need not become an expert here but it's useful to understand what `np.array`'s are and how they're used and manipulated. 

We recommend working with our Notebooks locally by performing a git clone on `https://github.com/makeabilitylab/signals.git` and running Jupyter Notebook (see [installation notes](jupyter-notebook.md)). However, for quick access, you can use:
