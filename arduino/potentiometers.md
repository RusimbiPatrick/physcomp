A [potentiometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potentiometer) (or pot) is a three-terminal resistor with a sliding or rotating contact that can be used to dynamically vary resistance. They are truly ubiquitous electronic components found in everything from volume controls to analog joysticks. 

In this lesson, we'll learn about potentiometers, analog input, and voltage dividers. Similar to the [buttons lesson](buttons.md), we are going to use potentiometers on their own before learning how to use them with microcontrollers.

<!-- Where to bring in circuit theory here? -->

## Making an LED dimmer with a potentiometer

<!-- TODO: before we make, show and have them play around with Tinkercad and Falstad JS simulator? -->

In Tinkercad, need to make breadboard

## Outline
- Use trimpot on own to change brightness of LED
- Just focus on trimpot or also slide potentiometer (could close with that?)?
