## TODO:

- Look at my curriculum sheet
- Add in design and design thinking books like Sketching User Experiences.
- Look at my resources list from [CMSC838f](https://web.archive.org/web/20170605201324/http:/cmsc838f-s15.wikispaces.com/). [Direct link](https://web.archive.org/web/20150709105051/http://cmsc838f-s15.wikispaces.com/Resources)
- Look at: http://ladyada.net/learn/arduino/
- Stanford's ENGR40m Arduino/making course:
  - https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/engr/engr40m.1178/slides.html
