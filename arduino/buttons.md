This is the first lesson in the [**Intro to Arduino Input**](intro-input.md) lesson series. This series builds on knowledge gained in the [**Intro to Arduino Output**](intro-output.md) lesson series, so please complete that first!

In this lesson, we'll finally get to build something interactive! Specifically, we'll cover buttons (aka momentary switches), working with digital input via [`digitalRead`](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/digital-io/digitalread/), and pull-up and pull-down resistors.

## Notes:
Things to remember:
- include Jeff Feddersen video of pull-up and pull-down
- show calculation about pull-down and pull-up resistors (and the fact that they should be high to not waste current)
