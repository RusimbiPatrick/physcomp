## Online Tutorials

- [Adafruit's 18-Step Learn Arduino Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/series/learn-arduino) is my most recommended "getting started" guide for Arduino. [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com), in general, has an extensive number of [online electronic tutorials](https://learn.adafruit.com/)—both for their own products and beyond.

<!-- The old version of the Adafruit Arduino tutorial is by Lady Ada herself: https://learn.adafruit.com/ladyadas-learn-arduino-lesson-number-0 -->

- [Sparkfun's Tutorial Series](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials). Similar to Adafruit, [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/) creates a large number of tutorials and videos to help the electronic/maker community (and build demand for their products).

- [NYU ITP's Physical Computing Course Website](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/). Tom Igoe's Physical Computing course at NYU's ITP offers a significant amount of online tutorials such as an introductory overview of [Electricity](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/lessons/electronics/electricity-the-basics/), [Sensors](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/lessons/sensors-the-basics/) and [digital I/O](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/lessons/microcontrollers/digital-input-output/). [Igoe](https://tigoe.com/) is one of the co-founders of Arduino and the author of [Physical Computing](https://www.amazon.com/Physical-Computing-Sensing-Controlling-Computers/dp/159200346X) and [Making Things Talk](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596510510.do)

- [Arduino's Official Tutorials](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/HomePage). Lots of tutorials from [foundational concepts](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Foundations) to explaining the built-in [Arduino IDE examples](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BuiltInExamples)

<!-- Instructables also has an 'Intro to Arduino' tutorial series: https://www.instructables.com/class/Arduino-Class/ taught by Becky Stern -->

## Video Tutorials

- [Physical Computing @ ITP/NYU](https://vimeo.com/channels/pcomp). This online video series by NYU ITP's Jeff Feddersen & Tom Igoe provides over 100 high-quality teaching videos about circuits, & Arduino

## Books

I've gone through many electronics and microcontroller books. Here are some of my favorites. I've attempted to provide EBook library links whenever possible.

### Electronics

- Charles Platt, *Make: Electronics*, 2nd Edition, Maker Media, 2015 [[UW Library EBook](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/kjtuig/CP71290798850001451), [O'Reilly Online](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/make-electronics-2nd/9781680450255/)]. The best 'Intro to Electronics' book I've found.

- Simon Monk, *Hacking Electronics: An Illustrated DIY Guide for Makers and Hobbyists*, McGraw-Hill, 2013. [[UW Library EBook](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/kjtuig/CP71297764200001451), [O'Reilly Online](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hacking-electronics-an/9780071802369/)]

### (More) Advanced Electronics

- Paul Scherz and Simon Monk, *Practical Electronics for Inventors*, 4th Edition, McGraw-Hill Education, 2016. [[UW Library EBook](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/kjtuig/CP71291894620001451), [O'Reilly Online](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-electronics-for/9781259587559)]. This is a more advanced book, *e.g.,* the first chapter entitled *Theory* is 200+ pages long.
  
- Michael F. Robbins, *Ultimate Electronics: Practical Circuit Design and Analysis*, [[Online Book](https://ultimateelectronicsbook.com/)]. [CircuitLab's](https://www.circuitlab.com/) free online textbook that includes over 134 interactive schematics and simulations.

- Charles Platt, *Make: Encyclopedia of Electronic Components Volume 1: Resistors, Capacitors, Inductors, Switches, Encoders, Relays, Transistors*, O'Reilly, 2012. [[UW Library EBook](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/kjtuig/CP71290698970001451), [O'Reilly Online](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/encyclopedia-of-electronic/9781449333881/)]

- Charles Platt, *Make: Encyclopedia of Electronic Components Volume 2: LEDs, LCDs, audio, thyristors, digital logic, and amplification*, O'Reilly, 2015. [[UW Library EBook](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/kjtuig/CP71290765560001451), [O'Reilly Online](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/encyclopedia-of-electronic/9781449334178/)]

- Charles Platt, *Make: Encyclopedia of Electronic Components Volume 3: Sensing Light, Sound, Heat, Motion, and More*, O'Reilly, 2016. [[UW Library EBook](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/kjtuig/CP71290815340001451), [O'Reilly Online](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/encyclopedia-of-electronic/9781449334307)]

### Microcontrollers

- Jeremy Blum, *Exploring Arduino: Tools and Techniques for Engineering Wizardry*, 2nd Edition, Wiley, 2020. This is my favorite Arduino book and assumes no previous electronics knowledge! [[UW Library EBook](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/kjtuig/CP51311244450001451), [Wiley Online](https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/doi/book/10.1002/9781119405320)]. Interestingly, Blum was inspired to work in physical computing after taking HCI Professor [François Guimbretière's](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~francois/) *Introduction to Rapid Prototyping and Physical Computing* course at Cornell.

- Dan O'Sullivan and Tom Igoe, *Physical Computing: Sensing and Controlling the Physical World with Computers*, Thomson, 2004. [UW Library Print Book](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/kjtuig/CP71142983320001451)

## Online Tools

### Circuit Simulators

- [CircuitLab](https://www.circuitlab.com/). The most popular online circuit simulator.

- [CircuitJS](https://www.falstad.com/circuit/circuitjs.html). A free online circuit simulator written in JavaScript.

### Circuit Design Tools

- [Autodesk Tinkercad Circuits](https://www.tinkercad.com/circuits). Build, code, and debug circuits and Arduino microcontrollers in an online simulator.

- [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/). Fritzing was the leading open-source circuit diagramming tool amongst the Maker community (and a tool I used extensively in my own teaching to create diagrams) but has struggled recently (see [*Future of Fritzing is Murky at Best*](https://hackaday.com/2019/02/14/the-future-of-fritzing-is-murky-at-best/). Evidently, there is a recent attempt to revitalize it ([*Is Fritzing Back?*](https://hackaday.com/2019/04/30/fritzing-is-back-and-this-time-its-written-in-javascript/))

## Where to Ask Questions

I *encourage* you to ask questions! There are so many people out there willing to help. Generally, however, please search your target forum before posting to see if your question has already been asked (and hopefully answered).

- **StackExchange**. The [Arduino](https://arduino.stackexchange.com/) and [Electronics](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/) StackExchange forums are extremely popular. 

- **Reddit**. While Reddit is not generally known as a thoughtful, respectful community, the subreddits for [r/arduino](https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/) and [r/diyelectronics](https://www.reddit.com/r/diyelectronics/) communities are helpful and supportive.

- **Online Forums**. The most popular electronics and Arduino-based Q/A forums, include: [Adafruit](https://forums.adafruit.com/viewforum.php?f=37&sid=39a6c8dce50981dcc363bdd5b0a77b23), [Sparkfun](https://forum.sparkfun.com/index.php), [Arduino.cc](https://forum.arduino.cc/), and [EEVBlog](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/).
