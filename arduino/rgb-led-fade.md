In this lesson, you will learn how to fade between RGB colors and how to use the [HSL colorspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV) to more easily (and independently) control hue and brightness.

## Materials

You'll need the same materials as the previous [RGB LED lesson](rgb-led.md). As a reminder, there are **two types** of RGB LEDs: a common cathode design and a common anode design, so make sure you know which one you have as it will affect the circuit you make and the code you write.

## TODO: fade between colors
- First with simple for loops
- Then with HSL
- Probably want to move this to some advanced section, so students can move on to input
