In our [first activity](led-on.md), we directly hooked up an LED circuit to the Arduino's 5V pin. While this enabled learning about Arduino's supply voltage and GND pins and gave us practical experience wiring electrical components into the Arduino ports, it was admittedly, a toy exercise.

In this activity, we are going to do something more exciting: use the Arduino to turn the LED on and off by programatically controlling the output voltage on one of Arduino's GPIO pins.

This begins our entrée into the two key parts of using microcontrollers: (1) building circuits and (2) writing code to interact with those circuits.

## Materials
You will use the same materials as before:

| Arduino | LED | Resistor |
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| Arduino Uno, Leonardo, or similar  | Red LED | 220Ω Resistor |
