Vibration motors are a specific type of "tactile actuator technology" or "haptic technology."

## Vibromotors

<!-- https://www.fictiv.com/articles/intro-to-haptic-technology-vibration-motors -->

There are two common types of vibration motors: **eccentric rotating mass (ERM)** motors that have a small unbalanced mass attached to the DC motor axle that creates a displacement force when rotating and **linear resonant actuators (LRA)** that contain a small internal mass attached to a spring, which vibrates in a linear motion with an applied AC signal. The video excerpt below from [Precision Microdrives](https://vimeo.com/132533086) shows how ERMs and LRAs vibrate.

**Video.** A [video](https://vimeo.com/132533086) from Precision Microdrives showing the two most common types of vibration motors: **eccentric rotating mass (ERM)** motors and **linear resonant actuators (LRA)**. ERM motors vibrate in two directions due to the centripetal force of the unbalanced mass attached to the DC motor axle. LRAs are similar in design to speakers:

ERMs are built with DC motors and an off-centered mass: they are cheap, provide a strong vibration, and are pervasive in toys, game controllers, mobile phones, and watches; however, they have a long startup time (~20-30ms) and limited controllability. For ERMs, you cannot individually control the frequency of the vibration (*i.e.,* how fast the mass is spinning) and the amplitude of that vibration—they are tied together. As the applied DC voltage increases, the frequency and amplitude of the vibration linearly increases, which is perceived as overall vibration intensity.

In contrast to ERMs, LRAs do not spin. They linearly move a mass (up and down) attached to a spring using an electromagnet. LRAs require an AC signal driven at specific resonant frequencies—usually 150-200Hz—which controls how often the mass moves and, therefore, the vibration oscillation. They are increasingly common in smartphones, watches, and trackpads to mimic the feeling of a click. While LRAs are more responsive than ERMs (~15-25ms startup times), their vibration strength is more minimal and the wiring circuitry more complicated.

If a vibromotor is fully enclosed in a shell, you cannot necessarily tell whether it is ERM or LRA even though the technologies are fundamentally different.

### Eccentric Rotating Mass (ERM) Motors

Eccentric rotating mass (ERM) motors have an unbalanced mass attached to their axle. When the ERM motor spins, the rotating mass's centripetal force causes displacement. By attaching an ERM to an object—like a smartphone or game controller—the vibrational movement will transfer onto the underlying object. The larger the object, the more force is needed to modulate the vibration onto the object.

</video>
**Video.** A [video](https://vimeo.com/128603396) from [Precision Microdrives](https://www.precisionmicrodrives.com/vibration-motors/) demonstrating how eccentric rotating mass (ERM) motors work. The idea is quite simple: attach an asymmetric or unbalanced mass to the DC motor's axle. When it rotates, the weight shifts causing a vibration.
{: .fs-1 }

#### Vibration frequency and amplitude

There are two main characteristics of a vibration: the vibration **frequency**, which is how fast the mass is spinning and the vibration **amplitude**, which is the strength of the vibration force. For ERM motors, you cannot vary the vibration frequency and amplitude independently—both linearly increase with the applied voltage.

DC motors spin at a rate proportional to the applied voltage. We measure "spin rate" in revolutions per minute (RPM); however, we measure vibration frequency in Hz (cycles per second). So, to convert RPM to the vibration frequency $$V_F$$ in Hz, we simply: 

$$
V_F = \frac{RPM}{60}
$$

The strength of the force generated by the ERM motor is:

$$
F = m \cdot r \cdot ω^2
$$

Where $$F$$ is the centripetal force in Newtons (N), $$m$$ is the mass of the eccentric mass (in kg), $$r$$ is the radius of the eccentric mass (in meters), and $$ω$$ is the angular velocity in radians/second (*i.e.,* the speed of the motor).

![](assets/images/ERMForceEquation.png)
**Figure.** The strength of the force generated by the ERM motor is: $$F = m \cdot r \cdot ω^2$$ where $$F$$ is the centripetal force in Newtons (N), $$m$$ is the mass of the eccentric mass (in kg), $$r$$ is the radius of the eccentric mass (in meters), and $$ω$$ is the angular velocity in radians/second. Image based on [video](https://vimeo.com/128603396) from Precision Microdrives.
{: .fs-1 }

However, when attached to an object, the vibration amplitude is also affected by the size of that object, which should make intuitive sense. The small ERM motor in your mobile phone, for example, which is used for alerts and notifications, would not cause much displacement if it was attached to your laptop or even your (far heavier) office desk. If you know the size of the target object, you can use this to inform the size and operating characteristics of your ERM motor.

</video>
**Video.** An ERM's vibration amplitude is not just a function of motor speed and eccentric mass size but also the size of the attached object. A larger object requires more force to vibrate. Video from [Precision Microdrives](https://www.precisionmicrodrives.com/vibration-motors/).

#### ERM form factors

There are a variety of ERM form factors from the basic cylindrical "pager" motor, which can be mounted directly to a PCB or fully encapsulated for waterproof versions to coin or "pancake" forms.

#### Example ERM motors

Because vibration amplitude is dependent not just on the speed of the ERM motor and size of eccentric mass but also the size of the affixed target object (*e.g.,* smartphone or watch), vibromotor datasheets often quote a "normalized vibration amplitude", which is the ERM's motor performance at its rated voltage when attached to a fixed mass. The Precision Microdrive datasheets use 100g to calculate its typical normalized amplitude.

## Wiring and assembly
TODO

## Transistors

The invention of the transistor in 1947 marked the beginning of the [computing revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing_hardware_(1960s%E2%80%93present)#Third_generation), allowing electrical circuits to rapidly switch off (`0`) and on (`1`) to create [logic gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate), [accumulators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accumulator_(computing)), and other computational building blocks. Before transistors, computers used [vacuum tubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube_computer), which were slower, less robust, much larger, and required significantly more power.

TODO: insert picture of variety of transistors

[Transistors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor) are semiconductor devices used to **amplify** or **switch** electronic signals. They are used in almost every modern electronic device from smartphones to headphone amplifiers and come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and operating specifications. There are two common designs: **BJTs** (Bipolar Junction Transistors), which we'll use in this lesson and are applicable to small-current loads (< 1A), and **MOSFETS** (Metal-Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors), which are well-suited for higher-current loads (and often come with built-in heat sinks).

TODO: insert pictures of two transistors.

While transistors deserve a full lesson in their own right (indeed, multiple lessons), for our purposes here, two attributes are relevant:

- First, transistors can **amplify** electronic signals. You can control transistors with *small* amounts of current (to turn them on and off) but the signal they control can be much *larger*. On the Arduino, recall that our GPIO pins can only supply 40mA of continuous current (maximum!); however, [RGB LED strips](https://learn.adafruit.com/rgb-led-strips/usage) can easily require 1A or more and even small [DC hobby motors](https://www.adafruit.com/product/711) use between 70-250mA. The tiny pancake vibromotor used in this lesson has a rated current of 75mA and a startup current of up to ~120mA—both beyond the maximum safe current of our microcontroller GPIO pins.

- Second, because transistors can **rapidly switch on and off**, they can use pulse-width modulation. That is, your microcontroller can supply a PWM signal to the transistor's control input, which will modulate the same PWM signal, but amplified, on the transistor's output. Thus, we can use PWM via our transistor to control the vibration strength of our vibromotor.

### The BJT Transistor

### Operating specifications

The [datasheet](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/product-files/1201/P1012_datasheet.pdf) for the [Adafruit vibrating mini-motor disc](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1201) states the following operating specifications.

| Attribute | Rating |
|-----------|--------|
| Rated voltage | 3.0V |
| Voltage range | ~2.5-3.8V |
| Rated current | 75mA |
| Rated speed | 11,000 ± 3,000rpm |
| Rated vibration frequency | 183 ± 50 Hz |
| Starting voltage | 2.3V |
| Starting current | Up to ~120mA |

The ERM vibromotor is a type of DC motor—though a very tiny one. STARTUP VOLTAGE to overcome inertia.

### Wiring up the vibro-motor

- Many examples online are wrong and directly hook up the vibromotor to a microcontroller's GPIO pins
- Be careful with the small wires. This is one of the most fragile components we've worked with: the tiny stranded wires soldered to the motor are prone to snap off.
- The vibromotor in our kits is this one supplied by [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1201), which has a rated voltage of 2.5-3.8V; however, the Adafruit docs suggest that 2-5V work. We have also found this to be the case; however, to be safe, you could use the 3.3V supply rather than the 5V on your board. 

![](assets/images/VibromotorTransistorCircuit_AbstractPictorialDiagramPlusCircuitDiagram.png)

Specifically, the NPN bipolar transistors we use in our courses are the [PN2222A](https://www.adafruit.com/product/756) transistors (and variants such as the [2N2222A](https://components101.com/transistors/2n2222a-pinout-equivalent-datasheet)).

You need a resistor in series with the control input pin (base pin) on the transistor. In this case, a 1kΩ resistor works well.

Though messier, we also [made a version](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/jGRVrL9C8Jv) with ammeters to track (1) the current through the vibromotor and into the transistor emitter, (2) the current into the transistor's base pin (the control pin), and (3) current out of the emitter.

## Generating haptic patterns

TODO: have students make a haptic pattern or two. Maybe schedule a timer interrupt to do this?

Are there Arduino libraries for this?

### Haptic motor drivers

When haptics play a key role in your project, consider using a [haptic motor driver](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/haptic-motor-driver-hook-up-guide?_ga=2.87552344.1190007566.1620233503-935977820.1612992862), which makes it easier to interface with vibration motors and drive complex haptic patterns.

For example, Texas Instruments (TI) sells a variety of [haptic motor drivers](https://www.ti.com/motor-drivers/actuator-drivers/overview.html). The popular [TI DRV2605](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/drv2605.pdf) provides a [I<sup>2</sup>C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C)-based interface to control both ERM and LRA motors, generates its own the pulse-width modulated (PWM) waveforms, which relieves the host microcontroller of this responsibility saving hardware pins and reducing code complexity (*e.g.,* setting precise timer interrupts for waveform generation), and includes an integrated library of 123 licensed haptic patterns, reducing the need to design and implement software to create custom haptic effects.

![](assets/images/TI_DRV205L_123LicensedHapticEffects.png)
**Figure.** The [TI DRV2605L](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/drv2605l.pdf) includes a preprogrammed library of over 100 haptic waveform effects, including single, double, and triple clicks, alerts, and transitions. These haptic patterns are licensed from Immersion Corporation. See page 63 of the [TI DRV2605L](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/drv2605l.pdf) datasheet.
