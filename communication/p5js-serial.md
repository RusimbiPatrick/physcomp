We've only started to scratch the surface of what's possible in combining Arduino+Computers.

- p5js demos (I've made three: one output only, one input only, one bidirectional).
- Could walk through them both in p5js editor and in vscode

## p5js Resources

After conquering the [OLED display](../advancedio/oled.md) and graphics rendering, p5js will feel both familiar and infinitely more expressive and accessible. [Processing](https://processing.org/) (for Java) and [p5js](https://p5js.org/) (for JavaScript) are some of my favorite programming environments, and I can't wait to share them with you.

There are some **amazing** p5js learning resources on the web. So, rather than replicate them, we'll simply share them with you!

- The official p5js [Getting Started](https://p5js.org/get-started/) guide, which walks you through an overview of p5js and the coding editor. We strongly recommend that you start here.

- The plethora of official [p5js examples](https://p5js.org/examples/)

- The Coding Train's [Programming with p5.js](https://thecodingtrain.com/beginners/p5js/) by Daniel Shiffman who probably produces the best, most interesting, fun, and accessible creative coding videos.

- The creator of p5js, Lauren McCarthy, wrote a book called [Getting started with p5.js : making interactive graphics in JavaScript and Processing](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/kjtuig/CP71274969160001451), which is available as an e-book via the UW library.
