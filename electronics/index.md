Welcome ðŸ‘‹ to the first "Chapter" of your Physical Computing journey!

In this chapter, you will learn about the fundamentals of electricityâ€”[voltage, current, and resistance](electricity-basics.md)â€”and how these elements can be used to build circuits that turn on lights, spin motors, and do other "work." You'll also learn about an empirically derived relationship, called [Ohm's Law](ohms-law.md), that relates voltage, current, and resistance together and methods to analyze circuits using Ohm's Law. Finally, you'll learn about two common circuit elements (resistors and LEDs), how they work, and how to use them in circuits.

By the end of this chapter, you will be prepared to start Chapter 2â€”which is our endeavor into using electronics with microcontrollers!

## [Lesson 1: Voltage, current, and resistance](electricity-basics.md)

Introduces three key electricity concepts, [current, voltage, and resistance](electricity-basics.md), which form the foundation of electronics and circuits.

## [Lesson 2: Circuit Schematics](schematics.md)

Introduces a visual language for describing circuits called [circuit schematics](schematics.md), which are used in component datasheets, CAD programs (*e.g.,* circuit simulators, PCB layout software), and circuit analyses. Also includes an activity using [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/) to build your own schematics.

## [Lesson 3: Ohm's Law](ohms-law.md)

Introduces [Ohmâ€™s Law](ohms-law.md), one of the most important empirical laws in electrical circuits that describes how current, voltage, and resistance relate together. Also includes an activity to build and explore resistive circuits in [CircuitJS](https://www.falstad.com/circuit/circuitjs.html).

## [Lesson 4: Series vs. Parallel Resistors](series-parallel.md)

Introduces [series and parallel resistor circuits](series-parallel.md), how to analyze them, and why they're important. Also includes an activity to build and explore series and parallel resistor configurations in [CircuitJS](https://www.falstad.com/circuit/circuitjs.html).

<!-- ## [Lesson 5: Resistors](resistors.md)

TODO: what are resistors, how to decode them, use them, etc. (Builds on Lesson 1)

## [Lesson 6: LEDs](leds.md)

TODO: what are LEDs, how to select resistors, how to use LEDs in series vs. parallel

## [Lesson 7: Variable resistors](variable-resistors.md)

TODO: what are variables resistors, how to use them, and how to make your own.

## [Lesson 8: Using a multimeter](multimeter.md)

TODO: or could integrate this somewhere else? 

## [Lesson 9: Breadboards](breadboards.md)

TODO: what are breadboards and how to use them

<!-- ## Old lesson plan

- L1: What is electricity: current, voltage, and resistance + online simulation activities
- Circuit schematics?
- LX: Common electronic components: resistors and LEDs
- L2: Ohm's Law + example circuit equations/solving + online simulation activities
- L3: Measuring current, voltage, and resistance using multimeters
- L4: Series vs. parallel resistance

- L4: How to use a breadboard + moving your prev circuit to breadboards
- LX: What are LEDs and resistors?
- L5: Series vs. Parallel Resistance, Voltage Dividers, and Ohm's Law
- LX: Building your first circuit: lighting up an LED, swapping out different resistances (maybe paper-based version)

Should I have a small lesson on what is a resistor and what is an LED (or perhaps I fold that into Lesson 2).
