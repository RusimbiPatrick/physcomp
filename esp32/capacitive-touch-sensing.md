The ESP32 has built-in circuitry and software for capacitive touch sensing ([docs](https://github.com/espressif/esp-iot-solution/blob/master/documents/touch_pad_solution/touch_sensor_design_en.md#1-introduction-to-touch-sensor-system)). In this lesson, we'll use the touch sensing functionality to X and Y.

## ESP32's touch sensor system

The ESP32's touch sensor circuit measures the total capacitance on a touch channel. When the capacitance changes and the amount of change exceeds the threshold value, the system can detect finger contact or proximity.

The ESP32 has 10 capacitive touch pins; however, only **eight** are exposed on the Huzzah32:

See the Adafruit Huzzah32 [docs](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-huzzah32-esp32-feather/pinouts) for details. Right-click and open image in a new tab to zoom in. For more details on the capacitive touch pins, see the Espressif [docs](https://github.com/espressif/esp-iot-solution/blob/master/documents/touch_pad_solution/touch_sensor_design_en.md).

### Advantages of touch sensing vs. physical buttons

Capacitive touch sensing is now widely used in household appliances, consumer electronics, and in industrial contexts. As the ESP32 [docs](https://github.com/espressif/esp-iot-solution/blob/master/documents/touch_pad_solution/touch_sensor_design_en.md#1-introduction-to-touch-sensor-system) enumerate, compared with mechanical buttons, capacitive touch sensing offers:
- No mechanical parts that wear over time
- Completely sealed surfaces (that can be waterproofed)
- Fewer components
- A modern look

However, the lack of physical buttons can reduce accessibility, especially for blind or low-vision users.
